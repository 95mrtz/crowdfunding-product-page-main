## My process

The first thing to clarify is that this challenge took me longer than it was, it really was a very big challenge, especially the part where I had to do modals with CSS.

The first thing as always was the structure, I put together all the parts of the HTML, both the fixed parts and the modals, to know how many sections it had.

The next thing was to style everything in desktop view, which was relatively simple, although there were many things that I was learning, such as the <progress> tag in HTML and how it can be modified with CSS, as well as how a <hr behaves > with Flexbox, after that, hide all the sections that would be modal.

Then things got a bit complicated to manage manners, I did it little by little, although it took me 2 and a half days to accommodate everything to my liking, I know it didn't turn out quite right.

Now comes the functional part, this with Javascript, where I know that the code can be greatly improved.

Then, for the mobile part, I know that it can also be improved a lot, but honestly I was very tired and wanted to finish it as soon as possible, the hamburger menu can be improved, as well as the manners.

This could be done in a very simple way with Bootstrap and thus save me many lines of code.
